# Email Feature Disabled

The email sending files were removed from this repository to protect sensitive credentials.

In the original project, PHP Mailer was used for:
- Forgot password email (ProccessForgotPassword.php)
- Email users when they're banned/unbanned (manageUsers.php)

For security reasons, SMTP credentials were removed.
